I am now an associate researcher at the [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT)](http://www.ict.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
Before that, I received my PhD degree from the ICT，CAS under the supervision of [Prof. Yongjun Xu](https://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496751.html) in July 2017. 

My major research interests are in Spatio-temporal Data Mining, Time Series Analysis, and AI for Science. My current research focus is on <b>scale-adaptive unsupervised spatio-temporal data (ST data) learning</b>, include：

* Cross-domain distribution characteristic analysis of ST data
* ST data synthesis
* Fair and scalable benchmark for ST models
* Architectural innovation of high-efficiency ST models
* Foundationa models based on ST data
* ST model application in diverse scientific and industrial fields
