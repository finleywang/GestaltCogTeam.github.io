I am now an associate researcher at the [Institute of Computing Technology (ICT)](http://www.ict.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
Before that, I received my PhD degree from the ICT，CAS under the supervision of [Prof. Yongjun Xu](https://www.ict.ac.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/200909/t20090917_2496751.html) in July 2017. 
My major research interests are in Spatial-temporal Data Mining, Time Series Analysis and AI for Science.
